# facedetector
The provided text describes a Python project for face detection using a pre-trained model from Google Teachable Machine. Here's a breakdown of the functionalities and instructions:

**Project functionalities:**

* Detects faces in images and video streams.
* Leverages a pre-trained model for face recognition.
* Designed to be beginner-friendly and customizable.

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.7 or higher
* OpenCV library
* NumPy library
* A pre-trained face detection model from Google Teachable Machine

**Training the face detection model:**

1. Visit the Google Teachable Machine website ([https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)) and click "Get Started".
2. Select "Image Model" under the "New Project" section.
3. Choose the "Standard Image Model" option.
4. Define the required classes (e.g., "face", "no_face") and upload training images using your webcam or Google Drive. Train the model and observe the classification accuracy.
5. Click on "Export the Model".
6. Under the TensorFlow tab, select "Download the model" to obtain a .zip file containing the model weights (.h5) and labels (.txt) files.

**Project setup and execution:**

1. Open your preferred code editor (e.g., PyCharm).
2. Extract the downloaded .h5 and .txt files from the .zip archive and save them in your project directory.
3. Open a terminal and install the required libraries (OpenCV, NumPy) using `pip install opencv-python numpy`. Ensure compatibility with your Python version.
4. Paste the provided Python code into your code editor.
5. Run the code. The program should successfully detect faces in images or video streams.

**Additional notes:**

* The text mentions "facefinder+", but it's likely referring to the overall face detection functionality achieved through the trained model and code.
* Double-check Python and TensorFlow version compatibility to avoid errors.
